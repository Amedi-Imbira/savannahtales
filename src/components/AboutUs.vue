            In the not-so-distant past, elders of the Savannah were highly
            respected figures. Their word held immense respect, and their wisdom
            guided members of the clan and community. What defined their divine
            wisdom was their age,and the experience they accumulated over the
            years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, the world has changed, and so is the role of the elders. The
            age and wisdom relationship has disappeared. In Savannah Tales, we
            believe that anyone can be an elder. Anyone with valuable experience
            on any topic or matter has divine wisdom, just like elders. Whether
            it is a young professional crushing it in the corporate world, or a
            veteran full of hard-earned insights. It doesnâ€™t matter. As long as
            you have a burning desire to share your stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Savannah Tales wants to home in all these insightful perspectives,
            useful knowledge and life wisdom. Unlike other platforms that are
            noisy and chaotic, Savannah Tales is calm and serene, just like the
            shrines of the Savannah.

            Ultimately, our main goal is to embrace and spread the Savannah
            culture through the power of writing. We envision a world where
            Savannah culture stands alongside great cultural legacies such as
            the ancient Greek and the western culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to grow Savannah members (council of elders) who align with
            our mission. Because our mission is to protect and spread the
            Savannah culture, we cherish and promote valuable stories that are
            deeply ingrained in the Savannah.
